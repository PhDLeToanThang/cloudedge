# Integrating Guacamole With Active Directory - LDAP user:

üîÉ Step 1: Ensure two-way LDAP traffic is available to the Guacamole application server:

If Guacamole is operating in a separate network from your Active Directory Servers, allow TCP 389 between all Guacamole application servers and all Active Directory Domain Controllers nominated in the config script settings below.

üîë Step 2: Establish the required accounts to bind with Active Directory LDAP:

An account with only Domain Users rights is sufficient for Guacamole to read and bind with Active Directory.

a. In the Guacamole application, create a new Guacamole account with full admin rights to the Guacamole application, e.g. guacbind-ad, and assign it an appropriately strong password. (Then log in with this new account and disable the default guacadmin account)
b. Create a new Active Directory domain account with EXACTLY THE SAME NAME as the new full admin account named above, only this time assign a DIFFERENT strong password than what was used above.

üìù Step 3: Edit the provided configuration script to reflect your specific Active Directory environment:

Below is the EXACT format to follow in editing the $USER_HOME_DIR/guac-setup/add-ldap-auth-guacamole.sh script. Be careful not to introduce new lines, spaces at the ends of lines or carriage returns. Anything outside of this format will cause the LDAP auth extension to fail. You have been warned!

ldap-hostname: dc1.yourdomain.com dc2.yourdomain.com dc3.yourdomain.com
ldap-port: 389
ldap-username-attribute: sAMAccountName
ldap-encryption-method: none
ldap-search-bind-dn: guacbind-ad@yourdomain.com
ldap-search-bind-password: guacbind-ad-password
ldap-config-base-dn: dc=yourdomain,dc=com
ldap-user-base-dn: OU=SomeOU,DC=yourdomain,DC=com
ldap-user-search-filter:(objectClass=user)(!(objectCategory=computer))
ldap-max-search-results:200
mysql-auto-create-accounts: true
Edit only the following values from the above example to suit your environment, then save the add-ldap-auth-guacamole.sh script:

ldap-hostname:
ldap-search-bind-dn:
ldap-search-bind-password:
ldap-config-base-dn:
ldap-user-base-dn:
mysql-auto-create-accounts: true
ldap-max-search-results:200
Important note on ldap-user-base-dn: This value sets a position in the directory as a relative root to search within. All Guacamole users to be authenticated by Active Directory must be placed in a lower position within the directory tree than this value. This line can be added multiple times to more efficiently search across multiple branches of a directory tree.

Important note on ldap-max-search-results: Yes, there is no space before the :200 value. In larger environments managing the directory efficiently requires that we don't query every object in the tree for every user lookup. You may need to adjust this number depending on the number of objects in your tree.

Important note on mysql-auto-create-accounts: This line is optional and can be deleted. This line ensures that all Active Directory user accounts will have a matching user account created in the Guacamole db at thier first Guacmaole logon with thier AD accout. All users who need MFA must have a local Guacamole account which is where this setting will be most useful. Local Guacamole db accounts are not needed for access to Guacamole and if not using MFA any regular Domain user can be provisioned access to Guacamole connections without this extra step.

üíª Step 4: Run the (now customised) LDAP configuration script:

sudo $USER_HOME_DIR/guac-setup/add-ldap-auth-guacamole.sh
If you use TLS with your AD implementation, there is an extra step... For more info see #18
Adjust this line in the above template for add-ldap-auth-guacamole.sh (Values can be none, ssl or stattls)
ldap-encryption-method: starttls 
Next, you must obtain your AD TLS cert.
openssl s_client -connect X.X.X.X:389 \
              -starttls ldap \
              -showcerts < /dev/null | \
              openssl x509 -text | \
              sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p'
Copy the certificate contents from -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- to -----END CERTIFICATE----- and paste this into a file
sudo nano /etc/ssl/certs/adcert.pem
Now import the AD cert file into the Java keystore
sudo keytool -importcert -alias adcert \
	-file /etc/ssl/certs/adcert.pem \
	-keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/lib/security/cacerts \
	-storepass changeit \
	-noprompt
Restart Apache Tomcat
systemctl restart tomcat9

üö™ Step 5: Logging on to Guacamole with the new guacbind-ad account:

When logging in to Guacamole as the new Active Directory account and password created above, that domain user is passed through to Guacamole as both a Guacamole admin and a Domain User. If all is working correctly, all the users located below the directory tree position set in ldap-user-base-dn will be listed under Settings | Users of the Guacamole management console.

üë• Step 6: Manually creating and configuring new Guacamole users for Active Directory authentication:

If not using the mysql-auto-create-accounts directive, manually re-create the exact user account names in Guacamole as those in the directory that you wish to give specific local adminstrative permissions or access to Guacamole. DO NOT configure a Guacamole password for any users that will be exclusively authenticating via Active directory. If AD users need MFA, better to implement MFA via AD globally rather via the Guacamole application. Guacamole local user accounts without a password are first given an MFA challenge by the local Guacamole application (if Guacamole's MFA is configured for that user locally) and then will be brokered to Active Directory for their Kerberos authentication challenge. Guacamole local user accounts that are given passwords in Guacamole will always refer to the local db for authentication, never Active Directory. This design allows for a matrix of local, domain, MFA & non-MFA access use cases to be deployed.

üîë Step 7: Logging on using either the local vs. the domain guacbind-ad account:

As described above, logging on with the Guacamole admin user password will authenticate with the local Guacamole admin account, conversely if the Guacamole admin domain account password is given, the domain account is authenticated via Active Directory and then passed through as authorized to administer Guacamole. It may sometimes be necessary to log on with the local Guacamole admin account to manage some application functions, but be aware that when doing so you will not be able to view and search the user list from Active Directory. Only when logged on with the domain version of the Guacamole admin account can domain user permissions to various Guacamole sessions and objects be delegated and managed.

‚öôÔ∏è Step 8: Creating a quasi Single Sign-On user experience for Windows RDP access:

Create a Global Security domain group (e.g., Guac_Users) and populate it with selected domain users as required.
Now add this new security group to the built-in ‚ÄúRemote Desktop Users‚Äù domain group.
Next, for each connection profile you wish to create the SSO experience and behavior, parameter tokens must be used in place of hard-coded usernames and password values as follows...
Add the parameter token ${GUAC_USERNAME} to the Username field for each connection profile
Add the parameter token ${GUAC_PASSWORD} to the Password field for each connection profile
If the user has been given directory rights to the Guacamole session object, Guacamole will first authenticate the user to the Guacamole application (via a brokered Active Directory challenge) and then seamlessly pass the user's same domain credentials through to the Guacamole remote desktop session, thus avoiding any further remote desktop authentication prompts.
For more info on other dynamic connection settings see Guacamole Documentation
Additional extensions are required for full SSO, but because centralised authentication / authorisation extensions require a bespoke approach to service providers and login behaviors, the SSO features are currently beyond the scope of this project.
